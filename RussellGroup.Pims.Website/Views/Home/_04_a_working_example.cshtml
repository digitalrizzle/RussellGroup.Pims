                        assigned, so you'll need to come up with the ID yourself. It doesn't need
                        to be unique but it may be more useful to you if it is.

                        to complete the name (it saves you having to type!) If the name you want
                        isn't there, that's ok, just continue typing in the name.

    <li>When you're done entering the data for the job, click the <strong>Create</strong> button.</li>
    <li>That's it! We just made a new job.</li>
</ol>
<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-danger">
    If you entered something wrong, like accidentally entering a name for the <strong>when started</strong>
    date, then a red description with what is incorrect will appear next to the problem. Go back and have a
    look at the problem, correct it, then click <strong>Create</strong> again. The job will only be created
    if everything has been entered as expected by the system.
</div>
<h4 id="make-changes-to-the-job">4.2. Make changes to the job</h4>
<p>
    We made a mistake in creating our job. We entered the wrong date! All we need to do is to find our job
    and edit it. Here's how:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>On the main menu, click <strong>Jobs</strong>.</li>
    <li>
        A list of all jobs will show. On the right hand side of the page is a search box. Click in this box
        and begin typing either the name of the job, the ID, or the date. Anything that matches what
        you started to type will narrow the list of jobs (this is called filtering) and will make it easier
        to find our job. In this example, click in the search box and start typing "1001".
    </li>
    <li>Find our job in the filtered list, then on the right hand side of the page click <strong>Edit</strong>.</li>
    <li>
        We're now back to job and we can make our changes. Change the <strong>when started</strong> date to
        1/10/2014.
    </li>
    <li>Click the <strong>Save</strong> button to save our changes.</li>
    <li>That's it! We just made changes to our job.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="hiring-out-plant-and-inventory">4.3. Checkout plant and inventory</h4>
<p>
    Now that we've set up our job, we can start hiring out plant and inventory against it. The process of
    hiring out plant and inventory from the yard to a job is called a "checkout".
</p>
<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
    <p>
        Here's an analogy. Say that our yard is actually a library and the plant and inventory are books. We
        go to the library and find what we need, sometimes several books at once, then go to the librarian to
        check out the books. Because the books have been checked out they are no longer available to use by
        anyone else. When we're done with the books we return them to the library and the librarian will check
        the books back into the library and they will become available to use again by someone else.
    </p>
    <p>
        So PIMS is our computer system of the library which records what has been checked in and out, and the
        users of PIMS (that's you) are the librarians.
    </p>
</div>
<p>
    Let's check out some of our plant and inventory.
</p>
<ol>
    <li>On the main menu, click <strong>Jobs</strong>.</li>
    <li>Find our job "1001" by using the search.</li>
    <li>
        On the right hand side of the page for our searched job, click on <strong>Checkout</strong>. We're now at the
        page where we can enter our checkout details.
    </li>
    <li>
        We need a docket number, so for our example let's use 90001. In the box next to the <strong>docket</strong>
        label type "90001".
    </li>
    <li>
        Set the <strong>when checked out</strong> date to when the plant was hired out. It defaults to the current
        date, so we can leave it at whatever it happens to be.
    </li>
    <li>
        Leave the <strong>job</strong> set to "My first PIMS job". When we searched for our job in the job list
        page and clicked <strong>Checkout</strong> it automatically set it to the job we wanted. If we
        searched for the wrong job we could change it here.
    </li>
    <li>
        Click in the <strong>plant hire</strong> box that says "begin typing a plant item..." and start typing
        the number "55724" which is the ID for the "Tandem Axle Trailer". As you begin to type a list of plant
        will appear. Click on the respective item in the list. Once you click on the item the box will become greyed-out
        and you will no longer be able to type in it.
    </li>
    <li>
        We want to add one more plant item for hire. This time will use the name "Tex 19PE Jack Hammer"
        which has an ID "55522". Click in the new <strong>plant hire</strong> box that appeared below the
        plant we just entered and begin typing the name "Tex 19PE Jack Hammer". Once you have typed enough
        letters it should appear in the list. Select the item so that the box becomes greyed-out.
    </li>
    <li>
        Now we'll checkout some inventory. Click in the box beside the <strong>inventory hire</strong>
        that says "begin typing an inventory item..." and start typing the ID "DD" for "Divvy Daggs".
        Select "Divvy Daggs" in the list that appears. Now go back to the smaller box that says "quantity"
        and enter 10.
    </li>
    <li>Click the <strong>Checkout</strong> button to checkout our plant and inventory.</li>
    <li>That's it! We just checked our some plant and inventory to our job.</li>
</ol>
<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-danger">
    When entering the ID or description of plant or inventory you must select it in the list that appears.
    You will know when it has been selected because the box where you started typing will change to grey.
</div>
<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
    If you made a mistake entering a plant or inventory item, click that minus sign at the end of the
    greyed-out box. This will remove the item.
</div>
<h4 id="what-has-been-hired-out">4.4. What has been hired out?</h4>
<p>
    Now that we've hired out some plant and inventory, what happens if we want to see what's been hired
    out? What we're wanting to know here is what are the transactions of the job? We're now going to
    view exactly what transactions have occurred.
</p>
<ol>
    <li>On the main menu, click <strong>Jobs</strong> and find our job "1001" by using the search.</li>
    <li>
        On the right hand side of the page for our searched job, click on <strong>Details</strong>. We're now at the
        page where we can see the details of our job including how many transactions for the job have
        occurred.
    </li>
    <li>
        Click on the link next to the <strong>plant hire</strong> label. We can now see a list of all
        the plant transactions.
    </li>
    <li>
        Click back on the browser to return to the job details page and this time click on the link next
        to the <strong>inventory hire</strong> label. We can now see a list of all the inventory transactions.
    </li>
</ol>
<h4 id="view-the-status-of-plant">4.5. View the status of plant</h4>
<p>
    When we checkout plant we are telling PIMS that the plant is in use and cannot be used by any other job.
    For every plant in PIMS there is a status, and when checking out plant the status changes from "available"
    to "unavailable". So how do we see what plant is available and what isn't? We can find out by looking at
    the plant listing.
</p>
<ol>
    <li>On the main menu, click <strong>Plant</strong>.</li>
    <li>Just like searching for jobs, find our plant "55724" by using the search.</li>
    <li>In the filtered list, examine the line for our plant and note the status. It will say, "Unavailable".</li>
    <li>We can find out more information about our plant by clicking on the <strong>Details</strong> link.</li>
</ol>
<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
    Inventory does not have a status since they are not unique items like plant.
</div>
<h4 id="make-changes-to-the-transactions">4.6. Make changes to the transactions</h4>
<p>
    We made a mistake when checking out our plant and inventory. For the "Tandem Axle Trailer" plant
    item we hired it out the day before, so we need to amend the date. For the "Divvy Daggs" we
    also hired it out the day before and hired out 20 of them instead of 10. Let's make our amendments.
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Go to the plant hire transactions page as in the previous section. (Hint: go to the job details page.)
    </li>
    <li>
        In the plant transactions listing locate the "Tandem Axle Trailer" line and click on the
        <strong>Edit</strong> link. We can now edit the transaction.
    </li>
    <li>
        Change the date to the day before.
    </li>
    <li>
        Click the <strong>Save</strong> button. We've just corrected our transaction!
    </li>
    <li>
        Now, go to the plant inventory transactions page as in the previous section. (Hint: go to the job
        details page.)
    </li>
    <li>
        In the inventory transactions listing locate the "Divvy Daggs" line and click on the
        <strong>Edit</strong> link.
    </li>
    <li>
        Change the date to the day before and the quantity to 20.
    </li>
    <li>
        Click the <strong>Save</strong> button. We've just corrected another transaction!
    </li>
</ol>
<h4 id="checking-in">4.7. Checking in</h4>
<p>
    Let's say that our plant and inventory have returned to the yard, so we need to check them back
    into the system. Remember, it's like returning the books to the library and the librarian is
    telling their computer system that the book has been returned and can be taken out by someone else.
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        On the main menu, click <strong>Jobs</strong> and find our job "1001" by using the search.
    </li>
    <li>
        On the right hand side of our searched job, click on <strong>Checkin</strong>. We're now at the
        page where we can see our plant and inventory that is currently hired out.
    </li>
    <li>
        We need another docket number, so for our example let's use 90002. In the box next to the
        <strong>return docket</strong> label type "90002".
    </li>
    <li>
        Set the <strong>when checked in</strong> date to when the plant was returned. It defaults to the current
        date, so we can leave it at whatever it happens to be.
    </li>
    <li>
        You'll see there are two sections: one for plant hire and the other for inventory hire.
    </li>
    <li>
        For the plant hire, check the checkbox beside "Tandem Axle Trailer". Leave the "Tex 19PE Jack
        Hammer" unchecked for now.
    </li>
    <li>
        For the inventory hire, check the checkbox beside "Divvy Daggs".
    </li>
    <li>
        Click the <strong>Checkin</strong> button. We've just checked in some plant and inventory!
    </li>
    <li>
        Go to the job details page for our job and take a look at the transactions. You'll now
        see that it says there are items that have been checked in.
    </li>
    <li>
        Now go to the plant listing page (as in section 4.5) and examine the status of our plant. It will
        say, "Available" because it has been checked in and can now by used by other jobs.
    </li>
</ol>
<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
    PIMS knows when an item has been checked in by having a <strong>when ended</strong> date in its transaction
    which can also be set on the plant or inventory hire transaction edit pages. But it's a lot faster and
    easier to use the <strong>Checkin</strong> page to do this.
</div>
<h4 id="deleting-a-transaction">4.8. Deleting a transaction</h4>
<p>
    Our last task for this working example is to delete a transaction. We may want to do this when we have
    accidentally checked out plant or inventory. For our example, we didn't mean to check out the plant
    "Tex 19PE Jack Hammer", so we're going to delete the transaction.
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Go to the plant hire transactions page as in the previous section. (Hint: go to the job details page.)
    </li>
    <li>
        In the plant transactions listing locate the "Tex 19PE Jack Hammer" line and click on the
        <strong>Delete</strong> link.
    </li>
    <li>
        We're now prompted to confirm the deletion. Click the <strong>Delete</strong> button.
    </li>
    <li>
        That's it! Our transaction has now been deleted.
    </li>
</ol>
