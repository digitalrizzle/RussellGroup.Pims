<h3 id="what-is-pims">1. What is PIMS?</h3>
<p>
    PIMS stands for Plant and Inventory Management System. In this system, the management is all about
    knowing what is on hand, where they are, and how much they have been used. We collect this information
    so that we can monitor the hire of plant and inventory in and out of the yard and ultimately bill the
    hire to the customer.
</p>

<h3 id="terms">2. Terms</h3>
<p>Here are some terms and what they mean that we'll use throughout this guide.</p>
<table class="table display table-striped order-column table-responsive table-help-guide">

                Similar to plant, these are items that are identical to each other that require
                tracking, and there may be many of them, but they do not need a unique identity.

            <td class="help-guide-term">Checkin</td>
            <td>

    </tbody>
</table>

<h3 id="how-it-works">3. How it works</h3>
<p>Here's how the system works:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The first thing to do is to make a job. It is this that all hire relating
        to a particular job can be hired out against. A job will have a description,
        when the job starts, its project manager and quantity surveyor.
    </li>
    <li>
        As plant is hired out, a record of this is captured against its job. This record of
        hire is called a transaction and it has a docket number, the plant ID, and when it was
        hired out. This process of hiring out a plant item is called "checking out". The plant
        item is no longer available to be checked out by other jobs because it is considered to
        be in use.
    </li>
    <li>
        Similarly to plant, inventory can also be hired out and this is recorded as well.
        However, unlike a plant item which has a unique ID there may be several of the same
        inventory item checked-out at one time. This quantity is recorded as part of the transaction
        along with a docket number (which could be the same as the plant hired out) and when it
        was hired out.
    </li>
    <li>
        As plant and inventory are returned to the yard, these returns are also recorded as
        transactions. This process is referred to as "checking in". Again, a new docket number
        is issued along with when the plant and inventory was returned. The return date is important
        because it not only tells the system that the items have been returned, it also makes them
        available again for other jobs and determines the period of hire for billing.
    </li>
    <li>
        At any point in time a report can be made of plant and inventory that is currently hired
        or has been hired. This report can be used for billing.
    </li>
    <li>
        When the job has finished, and all plant and inventory has been returned (or "checked in")
        a date of completion is recorded against the job. Plant or inventory can no longer be
        checked in or check out against this job because it has finished.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>So to summarise:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Make a job.</li>
    <li>Checkout plant or inventory against the job.</li>
    <li>Checkin plant or inventory as they come back to the yard.</li>
    <li>Repeat checking in and out plant and inventory for the duration of the job as needed.</li>
    <li>Complete the job by setting the completion date.</li>
</ol>
<p>
    That's it! All the data is captured during these steps and so reports can be generated to bill
    the customer.
</p>

    job and how to checkout, and in, plant and inventory.

                        assigned, so you'll need to come up with the ID yourself. It doesn't need
                        to be unique but it may be more useful to you if it is.

        </table>
    </li>
    <li>When you're done entering the data for the job, click the <strong>Create</strong> button.</li>
    <li>That's it! We just made a new job.</li>
</ol>
<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-danger">
    If you entered something wrong, like accidentally entering a name for the <strong>when started</strong>
    date, then a red description with what is incorrect will appear next to the problem. Go back and have a
    look at the problem, correct it, then click <strong>Create</strong> again. The job will only be created
    if everything has been entered as expected by the system.
</div>
<h4 id="make-changes-to-the-job">4.2. Make changes to the job</h4>
<p>
    We made a mistake in creating our job. We entered the wrong date! All we need to do is to find our job
    and edit it. Here's how:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>On the main menu, click <strong>Jobs</strong>.</li>
    <li>
        A list of all jobs will show. On the right hand side of the page is a search box. Click in this box
        and begin typing either the name of the job, the ID, or the date. Anything that matches what
        you started to type will narrow the list of jobs (this is called filtering) and will make it easier
        to find our job. In this example, click in the search box and start typing "1001".
    </li>
    <li>Find our job in the filtered list, then on the right hand side of the page click <strong>Edit</strong>.</li>
    <li>
        We're now back to job and we can make our changes. Change the <strong>when started</strong> date to
        1/10/2014.
    </li>
    <li>Click the <strong>Save</strong> button to save our changes.</li>
    <li>That's it! We just made changes to our job.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="hiring-out-plant-and-inventory">4.3. Checkout plant and inventory</h4>
<p>
    Now that we've set up our job, we can start hiring out plant and inventory against it. The process of
    hiring out plant and inventory from the yard to a job is called a "checkout".
</p>
<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
    <p>
        Here's an analogy. Say that our yard is actually a library and the plant and inventory are books. We
        go to the library and find what we need, sometimes several books at once, then go to the librarian to
        check out the books. Because the books have been checked out they are no longer available to use by
        anyone else. When we're done with the books we return them to the library and the librarian will check
        the books back into the library and they will become available to use again by someone else.
    </p>
    <p>
        So PIMS is our computer system of the library which records what has been checked in and out, and the
        users of PIMS (that's you) are the librarians.
    </p>
</div>
<p>
    Let's check out some of our plant and inventory.
</p>
<ol>
    <li>On the main menu, click <strong>Jobs</strong>.</li>
    <li>Find our job "1001" by using the search.</li>
    <li>
        On the right hand side of the page for our searched job, click on <strong>Checkout</strong>. We're now at the
        page where we can enter our checkout details.
    </li>
    <li>
        We need a docket number, so for our example let's use 90001. In the box next to the <strong>docket</strong>
        label type "90001".
    </li>
    <li>
        Set the <strong>when checked out</strong> date to when the plant was hired out. It defaults to the current
        date, so we can leave it at whatever it happens to be.
    </li>
    <li>
        Leave the <strong>job</strong> set to "My first PIMS job". When we searched for our job in the job list
        page and clicked <strong>Checkout</strong> it automatically set it to the job we wanted. If we
        searched for the wrong job we could change it here.
    </li>
    <li>
        Click in the <strong>plant hire</strong> box that says "begin typing a plant item..." and start typing
        the number "55724" which is the ID for the "Tandem Axle Trailer". As you begin to type a list of plant
        will appear. Click on the respective item in the list. Once you click on the item the box will become greyed-out
        and you will no longer be able to type in it.
    </li>
    <li>
        We want to add one more plant item for hire. This time will use the name "Tex 19PE Jack Hammer"
        which has an ID "55522". Click in the new <strong>plant hire</strong> box that appeared below the
        plant we just entered and begin typing the name "Tex 19PE Jack Hammer". Once you have typed enough
        letters it should appear in the list. Select the item so that the box becomes greyed-out.
    </li>
    <li>
        Now we'll checkout some inventory. Click in the box beside the <strong>inventory hire</strong>
        that says "begin typing an inventory item..." and start typing the ID "DD" for "Divvy Daggs".
        Select "Divvy Daggs" in the list that appears. Now go back to the smaller box that says "quantity"
        and enter 10.
    </li>
    <li>Click the <strong>Checkout</strong> button to checkout our plant and inventory.</li>
    <li>That's it! We just checked our some plant and inventory to our job.</li>
</ol>
<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-danger">
    When entering the ID or description of plant or inventory you must select it in the list that appears.
    You will know when it has been selected because the box where you started typing will change to grey.
</div>
<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
    If you made a mistake entering a plant or inventory item, click that minus sign at the end of the
    greyed-out box. This will remove the item.
</div>
<h4 id="what-has-been-hired-out">4.4. What has been hired out?</h4>
<p>
    Now that we've hired out some plant and inventory, what happens if we want to see what's been hired
    out? What we're wanting to know here is what are the transactions of the job? We're now going to
    view exactly what transactions have occurred.
</p>
<ol>
    <li>On the main menu, click <strong>Jobs</strong> and find our job "1001" by using the search.</li>
    <li>
        On the right hand side of the page for our searched job, click on <strong>Details</strong>. We're now at the
        page where we can see the details of our job including how many transactions for the job have
        occurred.
    </li>
    <li>
        Click on the link next to the <strong>plant hire</strong> label. We can now see a list of all
        the plant transactions.
    </li>
    <li>
        Click back on the browser to return to the job details page and this time click on the link next
        to the <strong>inventory hire</strong> label. We can now see a list of all the inventory transactions.
    </li>
</ol>
<h4 id="view-the-status-of-plant">4.5. View the status of plant</h4>
<p>
    When we checkout plant we are telling PIMS that the plant is in use and cannot be used by any other job.
    For every plant in PIMS there is a status, and when checking out plant the status changes from "available"
    to "unavailable". So how do we see what plant is available and what isn't? We can find out by looking at
    the plant listing.
</p>
<ol>

<h4 id="make-changes-to-the-transactions">4.6. Make changes to the transactions</h4>
<p>
    We made a mistake when checking out our plant and inventory. For the "Tandem Axle Trailer" plant
    item we hired it out the day before, so we need to amend the date. For the "Divvy Daggs" we
    also hired it out the day before and hired out 20 of them instead of 10. Let's make our amendments.
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Go to the plant hire transactions page as in the previous section. (Hint: go to the job details page.)
    </li>
    <li>
        In the plant transactions listing locate the "Tandem Axle Trailer" line and click on the
        <strong>Edit</strong> link. We can now edit the transaction.
    </li>
    <li>
        Change the date to the day before.
    </li>
    <li>
        Click the <strong>Save</strong> button. We've just corrected our transaction!
    </li>
    <li>
        Now, go to the plant inventory transactions page as in the previous section. (Hint: go to the job
        details page.)
    </li>
    <li>
        In the inventory transactions listing locate the "Divvy Daggs" line and click on the
        <strong>Edit</strong> link.
    </li>
    <li>
        Change the date to the day before and the quantity to 20.
    </li>
    <li>
        Click the <strong>Save</strong> button. We've just corrected another transaction!
    </li>
</ol>
<h4 id="checking-in">4.7. Checking in</h4>
<p>
    Let's say that our plant and inventory have returned to the yard, so we need to check them back
    into the system. Remember, it's like returning the books to the library and the librarian is
    telling their computer system that the book has been returned and can be taken out by someone else.
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        On the main menu, click <strong>Jobs</strong> and find our job "1001" by using the search.
    </li>
    <li>
        On the right hand side of our searched job, click on <strong>Checkin</strong>. We're now at the
        page where we can see our plant and inventory that is currently hired out.
    </li>
    <li>
        We need another docket number, so for our example let's use 90002. In the box next to the
        <strong>return docket</strong> label type "90002".
    </li>
    <li>
        Set the <strong>when checked in</strong> date to when the plant was returned. It defaults to the current
        date, so we can leave it at whatever it happens to be.
    </li>
    <li>
        You'll see there are two sections: one for plant hire and the other for inventory hire.
    </li>
    <li>
        For the plant hire, check the checkbox beside "Tandem Axle Trailer". Leave the "Tex 19PE Jack
        Hammer" unchecked for now.
    </li>
    <li>
        For the inventory hire, check the checkbox beside "Divvy Daggs".
    </li>
    <li>
        Click the <strong>Checkin</strong> button. We've just checked in some plant and inventory!
    </li>
    <li>
        Go to the job details page for our job and take a look at the transactions. You'll now
        see that it says there are items that have been checked in.
    </li>
    <li>
        Now go to the plant listing page (as in section 4.5) and examine the status of our plant. It will
        say, "Available" because it has been checked in and can now by used by other jobs.
    </li>
</ol>
<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
    PIMS knows when an item has been checked in by having a <strong>when ended</strong> date in its transaction
    which can also be set on the plant or inventory hire transaction edit pages. But it's a lot faster and
    easier to use the <strong>Checkin</strong> page to do this.
</div>
<h4 id="deleting-a-transaction">4.8. Deleting a transaction</h4>
<p>
    Our last task for this working example is to delete a transaction. We may want to do this when we have
    accidentally checked out plant or inventory. For our example, we didn't mean to check out the plant
    "Tex 19PE Jack Hammer", so we're going to delete the transaction.
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Go to the plant hire transactions page as in the previous section. (Hint: go to the job details page.)
    </li>
    <li>
        In the plant transactions listing locate the "Tex 19PE Jack Hammer" line and click on the
        <strong>Delete</strong> link.
    </li>
    <li>
        We're now prompted to confirm the deletion. Click the <strong>Delete</strong> button.
    </li>
    <li>
        That's it! Our transaction has now been deleted.
    </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="plant-status-and-condition">5. Plant status and condition</h3>
<p>
    Every plant in PIMS has a status to essentially indicate whether that plant is available to be hired.
    There are several status that the state of a plant may be in, most of which render that plant unable
    to be hired.
</p>
<p>
    The status of a plant can be changed by clicking <strong>Plant</strong> in the main menu, searching
    for your plant, and then clicking <strong>Edit</strong>. The ability to change the status may be
    disabled if the plant is already checked out. In this case, the plant must first be checked in and
    then the status can be changed.
</p>
<p>
    Here are the plant status types and what they indicate:
</p>
<table class="table display table-striped order-column table-responsive table-help-guide">

    Along with the plant status is its condition which indicates how well a plant is in

    database.
</p>
<h4 id="job-reports">9.1. Job reports</h4>
<p>
    The job reports give a listing of all plant and inventory that has been checked out for a specific
    job. The two are slightly different in that the plant report will show all plant that is currently
    checked out to a job at the time the report is run. This plant report is useful when doing a stocktake
    for plant on a job. The inventory report differs in that it will show all inventory that has been
    checked out and checked in since the beginning of the job. The items on both reports are grouped
    together by their category for ease of reading and finding specific items.
</p>
<h5>9.1.1. Plant</h5>

<h4 id="charge-reports">9.2. Charge reports</h4>
<p>
    The charge reports are used for billing from the system. All the checkout and checkin transactions
    the have been recorded are used in these reports. The reports require a start and end date for which
    to calculate the costs in that period. By default, the start date will be set to the first of the
    current month and the end date will be set to the current date. As with the job reports, items are
    grouped by category for ease of reading and finding specific items.
</p>
<p>
    There are three types of charge reports: plant charges for a specific job, inventory charges for a
    specific job, and a financial summary of all current jobs. All of these reports depend upon a specified
    date range.

<h3 id="user-management">10. User management</h3>
<p>
    User management deals with permitting individual users to perform tasks in the system. For example,
    you may want one user to create, edit and delete jobs but another user to only view the jobs without
    the ability of changing them.
</p>
<p>
    PIMS is an Intranet application and it piggy-backs off Windows authentication to identify a user.
    This means that the Windows login that is used to log into the organisation's network will be used
    as the user for PIMS. You can verify this by looking at the top righthand corner of PIMS. There it
    will display the currently logged on user.
</p>
<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
    All creates, edits and deletes are recorded in PIMS through an auditing process. These records
    cannot be accessed through the PIMS website but may be examined in the database backend of the
    system.
</div>
<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning">
    In order to follow the steps in this section you will need access to user management. Be sure that
