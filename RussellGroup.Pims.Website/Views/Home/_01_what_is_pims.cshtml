<h3 id="what-is-pims">1. What is PIMS?</h3>
<p>
    PIMS is an acronym for Plant and Inventory Management System. In this system the management is all
    about knowing what is on hand, where it is, and how long it has been used. We collect this information
    so that we can monitor the hire of plant and inventory in and out of the yard and ultimately bill the
    hire to the customer.
